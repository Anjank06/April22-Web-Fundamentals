    <h1> WEB TECHNOLOGIES</h1>

    <h2> HTML </h2>
    <P> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web
        browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</P>
    <p> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics
        for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and provide
        information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. </P>
    <p> HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and
        current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element, in collaboration with
        javascript.

    <h2> CSS </h2>
    <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is
        designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
        enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between
        the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
    <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based
        tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4] The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
        element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates
        a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]</p>

    <h2> JAVASCRIPT </h2>
    <P> n November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to Ecma International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in
        June 1997.</P>
    <p> standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.[20] Meanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market.</p>
    <P> By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%.[24] This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.</P>
    <p> initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on Ecma work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.</P>
