    <p> There are a million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on how to do so. But there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia. And that’s a topic we don’t discuss enough. </p>
    <p> Let’s begin with a quick story about two investors, neither of whom knew the other, but whose paths crossed in an interesting way almost a century ago. </p>
    <p>
        <h3> - </h3>
    </p>
    <p>Jesse Livermore was the greatest stock market trader of his day. Born in 1877, he became a professional trader before most people knew you could do such a thing. By age 30 he was worth the inflation-adjusted equivalent of $100 million. </p>
    <p> By 1929 Jesse Livermore was already one of the most well-known investors in the world. The stock market crash that year that ushered in the Great Depression cemented his legacy in history. More than a third of the stock market’s value was wiped out
        in an October 1929 week whose days were later named Black Monday, Black Tuesday, and Black Thursday. </p>
    <p> Livermore’s wife Dorothy feared the worst when her husband returned home on October 29th. Reports of Wall Street speculators committing suicide were spreading across New York. She and her children greeted Jesse at the door in tears, while her mother
        was so distraught she hid in another room, screaming. </p>
    <p> Jesse, according to biographer Tom Rubython, stood confused for a few moments before realizing what was happening. He then broke the news to his family: In a stroke of genius and luck, he had been short the market, betting stocks would decline. </p>
    <p> “You mean we are not ruined?” Dorothy asked. “No darling, I have just had my best ever trading day—we are fabulously rich and can do whatever we like,” Jesse said. </p>
    <p> Dorothy ran to her mother and told her to be quiet. In one day Jesse Livermore made the equivalent of more than $3 billion. During one of the worst months in the history of the stock market he became one of the richest men in the world. </p>
    <p> As Livermore’s family celebrated their unfathomable success, another man wandered the streets of New York in desperation. Abraham Germansky was a multimillionaire real estate developer who made a fortune during the roaring 1920s. As the economy boomed,
        he did what virtually every other successful New Yorker did in the late 1920s: bet heavily on the surging stock market. </p>
    <p> On October 26th, 1929, The New York Times published an article that in two paragraphs portrays a tragic ending: Bernard H. Sandler, attorney of 225 Broadway, was asked yesterday morning by Mrs. Abraham Germansky of Mount Vernon to help find her husband,
        missing since Thursday Morning. Germansky, who is 50 years old and an east side real estate operator, was said by Sandler to have invested heavily in stocks. </p>
    <p> Sandler said he was told by Mrs. Germansky that a friend saw her husband late Thursday on Wall Street near the stock exchange. According to her informant, her husband was tearing a strip of ticker tape into bits and scattering it on the sidewalk as
        he walked toward Broadway. And that, as far as we know, was the end of Abraham Germansky. </p>
    <p> Here we have a contrast. </p>
    <p> The October 1929 crash made Jesse Livermore one of the richest men in the world. It ruined Abraham Germansky, perhaps taking his life. But fast-forward four years and the stories cross paths again. After his 1929 blowout Livermore, overflowing with
        confidence, made larger and larger bets. He wound up far over his head, in increasing amounts of debt, and eventually lost everything in the stock market. </p>
    <p> Broke and ashamed, he disappeared for two days in 1933. His wife set out to find him. “Jesse L. Livermore, the stock market operator, of 1100 Park Avenue missing and has not been seen since 3pm yesterday,” The New York Times wrote in 1933. He returned,
        but his path was set. Livermore eventually took his own life. </p>
    <p> The timing was different, but Germansky and Livermore shared a character trait: They were both very good at getting wealthy, and equally bad at staying wealthy. Even if “wealthy” is not a word you’d apply to yourself, the lessons from that observation
        apply to everyone, at all income levels. Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another. </p>
    <p>
        <h3> - </h3>
    </p>
    <p> If I had to summarize money success in a single word it would be “survival.” </p>
    <p> As we’ll see in chapter 6, 40% of companies successful enough to become publicly traded lost effectively all of their value over time. The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans has, on average, roughly 20% turnover per decade for causes that don’t
        have to do with death or transferring money to another family member.¹⁷</p>
    <p> Capitalism is hard. But part of the reason this happens is because getting money and keeping money are two different skills. Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting yourself out there.</p>
    <p> But keeping money requires the opposite of taking risk. It requires humility, and fear that what you’ve made can be taken away from you just as fast. It requires frugality and an acceptance that at least some of what you’ve made is attributable to
        luck, so past success can’t be relied upon to repeat indefinitely. </p>
    <p> Michael Moritz, the billionaire head of Sequoia Capital, was asked by Charlie Rose why Sequoia was so successful. Moritz mentioned longevity, noting that some VC firms succeed for five or ten years, but Sequoia has prospered for four decades. Rose
        asked why that was: Moritz: I think we’ve always been afraid of going out of business. Rose: Really? So it’s fear? Only the paranoid survive? </p>
    <p> Moritz: There’s a lot of truth to that … We assume that tomorrow won’t be like yesterday. We can’t afford to rest on our laurels. We can’t be complacent. We can’t assume that yesterday’s success translates into tomorrow’s good fortune. Here again,
        survival. </p>
    <p> Not “growth” or “brains” or “insight.” The ability to stick around for a long time, without wiping out or being forced to give up, is what makes the biggest difference. This should be the cornerstone of your strategy, whether it’s in investing or
        your career or a business you own. There are two reasons why a survival mentality is so key with money. </p>
    <p> One is the obvious: few gains are so great that they’re worth wiping yourself out over. The other, as we saw in chapter 4, is the counterintuitive math of compounding.</p>
    <p> Compounding only works if you can give an asset years and years to grow. It’s like planting oak trees: A year of growth will never show much progress, 10 years can make a meaningful difference, and 50 years can create something absolutely extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p> But getting and keeping that extraordinary growth requires surviving all the unpredictable ups and downs that everyone inevitably experiences over time. </p>
    <p> We can spend years trying to figure out how Buffett achieved his investment returns: how he found the best companies, the cheapest stocks, the best managers. That’s hard. Less hard but equally important is pointing out what he didn’t do. </p>
    <p> He didn’t get carried away with debt. He didn’t panic and sell during the 14 recessions he’s lived through. He didn’t sully his business reputation. He didn’t attach himself to one strategy, one world view, or one passing trend. </p>
    <p> He didn’t rely on others’ money (managing investments through a public company meant investors couldn’t withdraw their capital). He didn’t burn himself out and quit or retire. </p>
    <p> He survived. Survival gave him longevity. And longevity—investing consistently from age 10 to at least age 89—is what made compounding work wonders. That single point is what matters most when describing his success. </p>
    <p> Charlie, Warren, and Rick were equally skilled at getting wealthy. But Warren and Charlie had the added skill of staying wealthy. Which, over time, is the skill that matters most. Nassim Taleb put it this way: “Having an ‘edge’ and surviving are two
        different things: the first requires the second. You need to avoid ruin. At all costs.” </p>
