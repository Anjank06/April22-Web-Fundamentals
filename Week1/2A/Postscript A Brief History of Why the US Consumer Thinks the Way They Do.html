    <p> To understand the psychology of the modern consumer and to grasp where they might be heading next, you have to know how they got here. How we all got here. </p>
    <p> If you fell asleep in 1945 and woke up in 2020 you would not recognize the world around you. </p>
    <p> The amount of economic growth that took place during that period is virtually unprecedented. If you saw the level of wealth in New York and San Francisco, you’d be shocked. If you compared it to the poverty of Detroit, you’d be shocked. If you saw
        the price of homes, college tuition, and health care, you’d be shocked. If you saw how average Americans think about savings and spending in general, you’d be shocked. And if you tried to think of a reasonable narrative of how it all happened,
        my guess is you’d be totally wrong. Because it isn’t intuitive, and it wasn’t foreseeable. </p>
    <p> What happened in America since the end of World War II is the story of the American consumer. It’s a story that helps explain why people think about money the way they do today. </p>
    <p> The short story is this: Things were very uncertain, then they were very good, then pretty bad, then really good, then really bad, and now here we are. And there is, I think, a narrative that links all those events together. Not a detailed account.
        But a story of how things fit together. </p>
    <p> Since this is an attempt to link the big events together, it leaves out many details of what happened during this period. I’m likely to agree with anyone who points out what I’ve missed. The goal here is not to describe every play; it’s to look at
        how one game influenced the next. </p>
    <p> Here’s how the modern consumer got here. </p>
    <p>
        <h3>--</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h4>1. August, 1945. World War II ends. </h4>
    </p>
    <p> Japan surrendering was “The Happiest Day in American History,” The New York Times wrote. But there’s the saying, “History is just one damn thing after another.” The joy of the war ending was quickly met with the question, “What happens now?” </p>
    <p> Sixteen million Americans—11% of the population—served in the war. About eight million were overseas at the end. Their average age was 23. Within 18 months all but 1.5 million of them would be home and out of uniform. </p>
    <p> And then what? What were they going to do next? Where were they going to work? Where were they going to live? Those were the most important questions of the day, for two reasons. One, no one knew the answers. Two, if they couldn’t be answered quickly,
        the most likely scenario—in the eyes of many economists—was that the economy would slip back into the depths of the Great Depression. </p>
    <p> Three forces had built up during the war: </p>
    <p> Housing construction ground to a halt, as virtually all production capacity was shifted to building war supplies. Fewer than 12,000 homes per month were built in 1943, equivalent to less than one new home per American city. Returning soldiers faced
        a severe housing shortage. The specific jobs created during the war—building ships, tanks, and planes— were very suddenly not necessary after it, stopping with a speed and magnitude rarely seen in private business. It was unclear where soldiers
        could work. </p>
    <p> The marriage rate spiked during and immediately after the war. Soldiers didn’t want to return to their mother’s basement. They wanted to start a family, in their own home, with a good job, right away. This worried policymakers, especially since the
        Great Depression was still a recent memory, having ended just five years prior. In 1946 the Council of Economic Advisors delivered a report to President Truman warning of “a full-scale depression some time in the next one to four years.” </p>
    <p> They wrote in a separate 1947 memo, summarizing a meeting with Truman: </p>
    <p> We might be in some sort of recession period where we should have to be very sure of our ground as to whether recessionary forces might be in danger of getting out of hand … There is a substantial prospect which should not be overlooked that a further
        decline may increase the danger of a downward spiral into depression conditions. This fear was exacerbated by the fact that exports couldn’t be immediately relied upon for growth, as two of the largest economies—Europe and Japan —sat in ruins
        dealing with humanitarian crises. And America itself was buried in more debt than ever before, limiting direct government stimulus. </p>
    <p>
        <h4>2. Low interest rates and the intentional birth of the American consumer.</h4>
    </p>
    <p> The first thing we did to keep the economy afloat after the war was keep interest rates low. This wasn’t an easy decision, because when soldiers came home to a shortage of everything from clothes to cars it temporarily sent inflation into double digits.
        The Federal Reserve was not politically independent before 1951.⁷² The president and the Fed could coordinate policy. In 1942 the Fed announced it would keep short-term rates at 0.38% to help finance the war. Rates didn’t budge a single basis
        point for the next seven years. Three-month Treasury yields stayed below 2% until the mid-1950s. The explicit reason for keeping rates down was to keep the cost of financing the equivalent of the $6 trillion we spent on the war low. But low rates
        also did something else for all the returning GIs. It made borrowing to buy homes, cars, gadgets, and toys really cheap. Which, from a paranoid policymaker’s perspective, was great. Consumption became an explicit economic strategy in the years
        after World War II. An era of encouraging thrift and saving to fund the war quickly turned into an era of actively promoting spending. Princeton historian Sheldon Garon writes: </p>
    <p> After 1945, America again diverged from patterns of savings promotion in Europe and East Asia … Politicians, businessmen and labor leaders all encouraged Americans to spend to foster economic growth.⁷³ Two things fueled this push. One was the GI Bill,
        which offered unprecedented mortgage opportunities. Sixteen million veterans could buy a home often with no money down, no interest in the first year, and fixed rates so low that monthly mortgage payments could be lower than a rental. The second
        was an explosion of consumer credit, enabled by the loosening of Depression-era regulations. The first credit card was introduced in 1950. Store credit, installment credit, personal loans, payday loans—everything took off. And interest on all
        debt, including credit cards, was tax deductible at the time. It tasted delicious. So we ate a lot of it. A simple story in a simple table: </p>
    <p> Household debt in the 1950s grew 1.5 times faster than it did during the 2000s debt splurge. </p>
    <p>
        <h4>3. Pent-up demand for stuff fed by a credit boom and a hidden 1930s productivity boom led to an economic boom.</h4>
    </p>
    <p> The 1930s were the hardest economic decade in American history. But there was a silver lining that took two decades to notice: By necessity, the Great Depression had supercharged resourcefulness, productivity, and innovation. We didn’t pay that much
        attention to the productivity boom in the ’30s, because everyone was focused on how bad the economy was. We didn’t pay attention to it in the ’40s, because everyone was focused on the war. Then the 1950s came around and we suddenly realized, “Wow,
        we have some amazing new inventions. And we’re really good at making them.” Appliances, cars, phones, air conditioning, electricity. It was nearly impossible to buy many household goods during the war, because factories were converted to make
        guns and ships. That created pentup demand from GIs for stuff after the war ended. Married, eager to get on with life, and emboldened with new cheap consumer credit, they went on a buying spree like the country had never seen. </p>
    <p> Frederick Lewis Allen writes in his book The Big Change: </p>
    <p> During these postwar years the farmer bought a new tractor, a corn picker, an electric milking machine; in fact he and his neighbors, between them, assembled a formidable array of farm machinery for their joint use. The farmer’s wife got the shining
        white electric refrigerator she had always longed for and never during the Great Depression had been able to afford, and an up-to-date washing machine, and a deep-freeze unit. The suburban family installed a dishwashing machine and invested in
        a power lawnmower. The city family became customers of a laundromat and acquired a television set for the living room. The husband’s office was air-conditioned. And so on endlessly. It’s hard to overstate how big this surge was. Commercial car
        and truck manufacturing virtually ceased from 1942 to 1945. Then 21 million cars were sold from 1945 to 1949. Another 37 million were sold by 1955. Just under two million homes were built from 1940 to 1945. Then seven million were built from 1945
        to 1950. Another eight million were built by 1955. </p>
    <p> Pent-up demand for stuff, and our newfound ability to make stuff, created the jobs that put returning GIs back to work. And they were good jobs, too. Mix that with consumer credit, and America’s capacity for spending exploded. The Federal Reserve
        wrote to President Truman in 1951: “By 1950, total consumer expenditures, together with residential construction, amounted to about 203 billion dollars, or in the neighborhood of 40 percent above the 1944 level.”⁷⁴ The answer to the question,
        “What are all these GIs going to do after the war?” was now obvious. They were going to buy stuff, with money earned from their jobs making new stuff, helped by cheap borrowed money to buy even more stuff. </p>
    <p>
        <h4>4. Gains are shared more equally than ever before.</h4>
    </p>
    <p> The defining characteristic of economics in the 1950s is that the country got rich by making the poor less poor. Average wages doubled from 1940 to 1948, then doubled again by 1963. And those gains focused on those who had been left behind for decades
        before. The gap between rich and poor narrowed by an extraordinary amount. Lewis Allen wrote in 1955: The enormous lead of the well-to-do in the economic race has been considerably reduced. It is the industrial workers who as a group have done
        best—people such as a steelworker’s family who used to live on $2,500 and now are getting $4,500, or the highly skilled machine-tool operator’s family who used to have $3,000 and now can spend an annual $5,500 or more. As for the top one percent,
        the really well-to-do and the rich, whom we might classify very roughly indeed as the $16,000-and-over group, their share of the total national income, after taxes, had come down by 1945 from 13 percent to 7 percent. </p>
    <p> This was not a short-term trend. Real income for the bottom 20% of wageearners grew by a nearly identical amount as the top 5% from 1950 to 1980. The equality went beyond wages. Women held jobs outside the home in record numbers. Their labor force
        participation rate went from 31% after the war to 37% by 1955, and to 40% by 1965. Minorities gained, too. After the 1945 inauguration Eleanor Roosevelt wrote about an African American reporter who told her: Do you realize what twelve years have
        done? If at the 1933 reception a number of colored people had gone down the line and mixed with everyone else in the way they did today, every paper in the country would have reported it. We do not even think it is news and none of us will mention
        it. </p>
    <p> Women and minority rights were still a fraction of what they are today. But the progress toward equality in the late ’40s and ’50s was extraordinary. The leveling out of classes meant a leveling out of lifestyles. Normal people drove Chevys. Rich
        people drove Cadillacs. TV and radio equalized the entertainment and culture people enjoyed regardless of class. Mail-order catalogs equalized the clothes people wore and the goods they bought regardless of where they lived. Harper’s Magazine
        noted in 1957: The rich man smokes the same sort of cigarettes as the poor man, shaves with the same sort of razor, uses the same sort of telephone, vacuum cleaner, radio, and TV set, has the same sort of lighting and heating equipment in his
        house, and so on indefinitely. The differences between his automobile and the poor man’s are minor. Essentially they have similar engines, similar fittings. In the early years of the century there was a hierarchy of automobiles. </p>
    <p> Paul Graham wrote in 2016 about what something as simple as there only being three TV stations did to equalize culture: </p>
    <p> It’s difficult to imagine now, but every night tens of millions of families would sit down together in front of their TV set watching the same show, at the same time, as their next door neighbors. What happens now with the Super Bowl used to happen
        every night. We were literally in sync.⁷⁵ This was important. People measure their well-being against their peers. And for most of the 1945–1980 period, people had a lot of what looked like peers to compare themselves to. Many people—most people—lived
        lives that were either equal or at least fathomable to those around them. The idea that people’s lives equalized as much as their incomes is an important point of this story we’ll come back to. </p>
    <p>
        <h4>5. Debt rose tremendously. But so did incomes, so the impact wasn’t a big deal.</h4>
    </p>
    <p> Household debt increased fivefold from 1947 to 1957 due to the combination of the new consumption culture, new debt products, and interest rates subsidized by government programs, and held low by the Federal Reserve. But income growth was so strong
        during this period that the impact on households wasn’t severe. And household debt was so low to begin with after the war. The Great Depression wiped out a lot of it, and household spending was so curtailed during the war that debt accumulation
        was restricted. So the growth in household debt-to-income from 1947–1957 was manageable. Household debt-to-income today is just over 100%. Even after rising in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, it stayed below 60%. Driving a lot of this debt boom was
        a surge in home ownership. </p>
    <p> The homeownership rate in 1900 was 47%. It stayed right about there for the next four decades. Then it took off, hitting 53% by 1945 and 62% by 1970. A substantial portion of the population was now using debt that previous generations would not—could
        not—have accessed. And they were mostly OK with it. David Halberstam writes in his book The Fifties: They were confident in themselves and their futures in a way that [those] growing up in harder times found striking. They did not fear debt as
        their parents had … They differed from their parents not just in how much they made and what they owned but in their belief that the future had already arrived. As the first homeowners in their families, they brought a new excitement and pride
        with them to the store as they bought furniture or appliances—in other times young couples might have exhibited such feelings as they bought clothes for their first baby. It was as if the very accomplishment of owning a home reflected such an
        immense breakthrough that nothing was too good to buy for it. </p>
    <p> Now’s a good time to connect a few things, as they’ll become increasingly important: America is booming. It’s booming together like never before. It’s booming with debt that isn’t a big deal at the time because it’s still low relative to income and
        there’s a cultural acceptance that debt isn’t a scary thing. </p>
    <p>
        <h4>6. Things start cracking.</h4>
    </p>
    <p> 1973 was the first year where it became clear the economy was walking down a new path. The recession that began that year brought unemployment to the highest it had been since the 1930s. Inflation surged. But unlike the post-war spikes, it stayed
        high. Short-term interest rates hit 8% in 1973, up from 2.5% a decade earlier. And you have to put all of that in the context of how much fear there was between Vietnam, riots, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King, and John and Bobby Kennedy.
        It got bleak. </p>
    <p> America dominated the world economy in the two decades after the war. Many of the largest countries had their manufacturing capacity bombed into rubble. But as the 1970s emerged, that changed. Japan was booming. China’s economy was opening up. The
        Middle East was flexing its oil muscles. A combination of lucky economic advantages and a culture shared by the Greatest Generation—hardened by the Depression and anchored in systematic cooperation from the war—shifted when Baby Boomers began
        coming of age. A new generation that had a different view of what’s normal hit at the same time a lot of the economic tailwinds of the previous two decades ended. Everything in finance is data within the context of expectations. One of the biggest
        shifts of the last century happened when the economic winds began blowing in a different, uneven direction, but people’s expectations were still rooted in a post-war culture of equality. Not necessarily equality of income, although there was that.
        But equality in lifestyle and consumption expectations; the idea that someone earning a 50th percentile income shouldn’t live a life dramatically different than someone in the 80th or 90th percentile. And that someone in the 99th percentile lived
        a better life, but still a life that someone in the 50th percentile could comprehend. That’s how America worked for most of the 1945–1980 period. It doesn’t matter whether you think that’s morally right or wrong. It just matters that it happened.
    </p>
    <p> Expectations always move slower than facts. And the economic facts of the years between the early 1970s through the early 2000s were that growth continued, but became more uneven, yet people’s expectations of how their lifestyle should compare to
        their peers did not change. </p>
    <p>
        <h4>7. The boom resumes, but it’s different than before.</h4>
    </p>
    <p> Ronald Reagan’s 1984 “Morning in America” ad declared: It’s morning again in America. Today more men and women will go to work than ever before in our country’s history. With interest rates at about half the record highs of 1980, nearly 2,000 families
        today will buy new homes, more than at any time in the past four years. This afternoon 6,500 young men and women will be married, and with inflation at less than half of what it was just four years ago, they can look forward with confidence to
        the future. That wasn’t hyperbole. GDP growth was the highest it had been since the 1950s. By 1989 there were six million fewer unemployed Americans than there were seven years before. The S&P 500 rose almost fourfold between 1982 and 1990. Total
        real GDP growth in the 1990s was roughly equal to that of the 1950s—40% vs. 42%.</p>
    <p> President Clinton boasted in his 2000 State of the Union speech: </p>
    <p> We begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates
        on record; the first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years; and next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy. His last sentence was important. It was a new economy. The
        biggest difference between the economy of the 1945–1973 period and that of the 1982–2000 period was that the same amount of growth found its way into totally different pockets. </p>
    <p> You’ve probably heard these numbers but they’re worth rehashing. <br> The Atlantic writes: Between 1993 and 2012, the top 1 percent saw their incomes grow 86.1 percent, while the bottom 99 percent saw just 6.6 percent growth. Joseph Stiglitz in 2011:
        While the top 1 percent have seen their incomes rise 18 percent over the past decade, those in the middle have actually seen their incomes fall. For men with only high-school degrees, the decline has been precipitous—12 percent in the last quarter-century
        alone. It was nearly the opposite of the flattening that occurred after the war. </p>
    <p> Why this happened is one of the nastiest debates in economics, topped only by the debate over what we should do about it. Lucky for the purpose of this discussion, neither matters. All that matters is that sharp inequality became a force over the
        last 35 years, and it happened during a period where, culturally, Americans held onto two ideas rooted in the post-WW2 economy: That you should live a lifestyle similar to most other Americans, and that taking on debt to finance that lifestyle
        is acceptable.</p>
